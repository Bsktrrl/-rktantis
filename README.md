# Arídea: The Forgotten Desert
This is a Game demo of a Survival Adventure game, made as a bachelor project in "Game Technology and Simulation" at Høgskolen Innlandet. The demo feature the first biome in the game, where the player is sent to the desert by its mentor in the search of 5 keys to the gate blocking the entrance to the forgotten city Arídea. The demo ends with the player acquiring one of the keys.
<br>
<br>
This is a classical Survival Adventure game where the goal of the player is to survive and explore, find resources and craft them into useful tools, improving the gameplay.

## Project Description
The purpose of this project has been to *create a first level of a Survival Adventure game* and see if this was possible in the time period of one semester. The group featured two students, one designer an one programmer, where all assets and code has been made from scratch.

## The Identity of the game
The Identity of the game lays in the elemental ghosts which are roaming the lands. The ghosts can be captured and their elements extracted for use in machines, advancing the game. The ghosts only turns visible in the range of an Arídean light source, and it's up to the player to hunt them down. Later in the game, the player will get hold of information that make them question the ghosts' identity and if what they do to them is ethically questionable.

## Inventory and Items
For our inventory we have taken inspiration from "Subnautica", making an upgradeable grid-based system with items of different sizes. Resources can be gathered from the world or transferred from/to chests for storage. Resources are deleted from the player inventory during game over, leaving only key items behind.

## Base Building
There is no proper Survival Adventure game without base building. The desert is hot and if not careful, the player may die of heat stroke. Building bases all across the desert will shelter the player, leaving higher survival possibilities. The player may also furnish its base with tables (Crafting, Research and Upgrade) and machines to advance in the game.

<br>

## Tables
In the game, three tables are essential for the games' progression.<br> 
The "Research Table" let the player research resources form the world, making recipes appear in the Crafting table.<br>
The "Crafting Table" let the player acquire tools and items to advance the game.<br>
The "Upgrade Table" functions as the players' quests, in the sense that the player can invest resources to upgrade different parts of the gameplay.
<table width="70%">
      <tr><td><b>Research Resources</b></td>
      <td><b>Upgrades</b></td></tr>

      <td><img src="https://github.com/Bsktrrl/Bsktrrl.github.io/blob/main/images/Aridea/video10.gif"/></td>
</table>

## World Building
Even if the demo focus mostly on the concrete aspects of the game, there is an underlying story that can be found by the player. Through research notes found across the game, the player gets introduced to its mentor and why he sent you to the desert. Through hidden images scattered across the biomes, an ancient story about the Adrídean people and how Arídea became forgotten, is unfold. This story will progress alongside the gameplay, and will reward players for taking their time searching.
