    message: "I've finally found it! The ancient city of Ar\xEDdea! The secrets of
      harnessing powerful magic is right in front of me! But the gate is sealed.
      I can feel an arcane aura and I've already found crystals that seems to light
      up things that weren't there before. And I swear I've seen something moving
      around. I must find a way inside! If I am to traverse the desert, I'll need
      to gather resources and build some temporary shelters."

    message: "This desert is treacherous! I've had to gather many resources and use
      them wisely to survive. The cacti here make for decent enough food, but I am
      happy that my apprentice has been able to gather some other plants to eat,
      although they were apparently not easy to find. Some of them seem to be imbued
      with magical energy left over from Ar\xEDdea."

    message: I've found that there are elemental creatures flying around, but they
      can only be seen in the light of the crystals. I have even been able to craft
      an item that can capture them. I have sent my apprentice out to find some good
      specimen, although she didn't seem too happy about the task. If I could find
      a way to extract their elemental energy, that could make survival in this harsh
      climate much easier.
