    message: "I stepped off the sand-swept dunes of the Ar\xEDdian Desert, sent by
      my mentor, Asher, on a quest to find him. But now, I find myself lost, the
      relentless sun beating down on me as I struggle to orient myself in this vast
      expanse of shifting sands.\r\n\r\nAs I try to gather my thoughts, a flicker
      of movement catches my eye. A spectral figure, translucent and shimmering,
      floats before me, clutching a radiant crystal in its ethereal grasp. Startled,
      I freeze in place as the ghostly entity gazes directly at me before suddenly
      leaping into the air, dropping the crystal to the ground with a soft thud.
      With a fleeting glance, the ghost vanishes into thin air, leaving me alone
      with the mysterious artifact.\r\n\r\nThe crystal lies at the base of a weathered
      stone-carved building, its ancient walls bearing the weight of countless years
      beneath the desert sun. Determination courses through me as I realize that
      this may be the clue I've been searching for. With renewed resolve, I set out
      to explore the enigmatic structure, hoping to uncover the secrets it holds
      within its ancient halls."

    message: 'I stumbled upon something hard in the sand. When I piked it up, I realised
      it was a Tablet. I tried to shake it and suddenly it turned on.


      I took
      a minute before I realsed that the tablet gives information about me an what
      I have equipped.


      - The first panel shows all of my items from my backpack.

      -
      The second panel shows different recipes of what I asume I can start building
      once I get hold of a Hammer.

      - The third panel keeps track of the report
      notes I write on this excursion.

      - And for some reason, the last panel
      let me change my view and nuffles the sound around me.


      I do question
      the tablets existance, but I immediately find it convenient and think I will
      keep a hold of it for some time.'

    title: One Entrance and Tree Tables

    message: 'As I entered the building, a sense of mystery enveloped me. The air
      was thick with anticipation, and my heart raced with excitement. At the far
      end of the room, a massive door loomed, adorned with five keyholes scattered
      across its surface. I knew instinctively that unlocking this door held the
      key to uncovering the secrets hidden within.


      With determination fueling
      my steps, I approached the door, only to find it firmly shut. It became clear
      that the only way to open it was by collecting all five keys, rumored to be
      scattered across the vast expanse of the Aridian Desert.


      Turning my
      attention to the tables on the right side of the room, I discovered three distinct
      stations. The first was a crafting table, its surface barren save for a list
      of items yet to be crafted. Next to it stood a research table, promising to
      unlock new crafting recipes with each new discovery. And finally, a skill tree
      table awaited, offering the opportunity to enhance my abilities with each resource
      invested.


      As I surveyed the room, a realization dawned upon me: these
      tables were not left here by chance. They were the work of my mentor, guiding
      me on a journey into the forgotten city of Aridia. With newfound purpose, I
      set out to explore the desert, armed with determination and the knowledge bestowed
      upon me.

      my heart raced with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. It had been dropped
      by the elemental Ghost I had encountered outside this ruin. As I held the crystal
      aloft, mesmerizing rune-like images began to emerge from the surrounding walls,
      glowing faintly in the dim light of the chamber.\r\n\r\nAwe washed over me
      as I marveled at the hidden secrets that this mysterious crystal held within
      its depths. Could it be that this crystal possessed spatial powers beyond my
      wildest imagination? I found myself pondering the possibilities, my mind racing
      with thoughts of the wonders that lay undiscovered.\r\n\r\nBut as the images
      danced before my eyes, a nagging question lingered in the depths of my mind:
      Was there more to this crystal than met the eye? Could it hold even greater
      revelations, waiting to be unlocked by one brave enough to seek them out?\r\n\r\nWith
      a sense of determination coursing through my veins, I vowed to delve deeper

      What
      am I supposed to do with it?


      I believe there is a machine of some sort
      that the tablet can show me the recipe for. This ghost is of the "Water" element.
      That means that if I find a way to extract the water, I can use it for good!'
